# Security Queries Worth Sharing on GitHub - Executive Summary

## Key Findings

Based on comprehensive research into GitHub's policies, industry best practices, and community standards, here are the essential guidelines for sharing security content on GitHub:

## ‚úÖ APPROPRIATE Security Content to Share

### 1. Educational and Training Resources
- Security tutorials and learning materials
- Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges
- Secure coding guidelines and best practices
- Academic research and case studies
- Security awareness training materials

### 2. Defensive Security Tools
- Vulnerability scanners for authorized testing
- Security monitoring and incident response tools
- Cryptographic libraries and security frameworks
- Configuration assessment utilities
- Compliance checking tools

### 3. Research Findings (Post-Disclosure)
- Vulnerability research following responsible disclosure
- Threat intelligence analysis (appropriately sanitized)
- Security tool effectiveness evaluations
- Proof-of-concept demonstrations (educational focus)

### 4. Standards and Documentation
- Security standards and frameworks (OWASP, NIST)
- Implementation guidelines and checklists
- Security architecture documentation
- Incident response playbooks

## ‚ùå CONTENT TO AVOID

### 1. Prohibited Content
- Complete malware source code
- Fully functional exploit tools
- Attack infrastructure and C&C frameworks
- Personal information and credentials
- Zero-day vulnerabilities (pre-disclosure)

### 2. High-Risk Content
- Operational exploit code
- Tools designed specifically for malicious use
- Detailed attack methodologies without educational context
- Sensitive vulnerability details before vendor remediation

## üîë Key Principles

### Responsible Disclosure
- Follow 90-day disclosure timeline (industry standard)
- Private notification to vendors first
- Coordinate public disclosure timing
- Focus on defensive value over exploitation details

### Documentation Requirements
- Clear README with purpose and warnings
- Comprehensive usage instructions
- Legal and ethical guidelines
- Appropriate disclaimers and limitations

### Legal and Ethical Compliance
- Ensure all testing is legal and authorized
- Respect privacy and confidentiality
- Provide proper attribution
- Follow applicable export control regulations

## üìã Best Practices Checklist

- [ ] Assessed potential for misuse
- [ ] Prepared comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Considered legal and ethical implications

### Repository Structure:
- [ ] Clear and detailed README file
- [ ] SECURITY.md file for vulnerability reporting
- [ ] Appropriate open source license
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Clear contribution guidelines

### Content Presentation:
- [ ] Educational focus and context
- [ ] Appropriate warnings and disclaimers
- [ ] Defensive rather than offensive emphasis
- [ ] Clear intended use cases
- [ ] Regular updates and maintenance
